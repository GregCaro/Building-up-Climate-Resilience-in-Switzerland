# Hackathon â€“ Open Data Access
Welcome to the Hackathon on **AI for Resilience against Extreme Weather Events**!  
In this challenge, you will use **open-source weather and climate data from MeteoSwiss** to build AI-powered solutions that help society become more resilient against **extreme weather events in Switzerland**.  

Your solutions might include:
- **Innovative Parametric Solutions** (trigger-based payouts using weather indices)  
- **Intelligent Disaster Response Systems** (e.g., optimizing resource allocation or damage assessment)  
- **Early Warning Systems** (e.g., severe storm / flood alerts)  

To get started, you will need weather and climate data.

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources

We will use the **official MeteoSwiss open data**.  
You have two main options to access it:

---

### 1. Download Manually (No Coding Required)

MeteoSwiss provides an easy interface for downloading datasets in **CSV** or **TXT** format:

ðŸ‘‰ [MeteoSwiss Data Download Portal](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/applications/ext/download-data-without-coding-skills.htm)

From there, you can:
- Select different meteorological parameters (temperature, precipitation, sunshine, wind, etc.)
- Choose a station and timeframe
- Export the data directly

Weâ€™ve also added a **few sample CSVs** in this repository (`/data` folder) so you can quickly test your pipelines.

### 2. Access via API (Programmatic Access)

For automated workflows and larger projects, you can fetch data using the **MeteoSwiss Opendata API**.
ðŸ“– Documentation: [MeteoSwiss Opendata GitHub](https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/publication-opendata)

Key features:
- REST-like API  
- Data available in **JSON, CSV, and XML**  
- Includes observations, forecasts, and gridded datasets

#### Example: Fetch station metadata
```bash
curl https://data.geo.admin.ch/ch.meteoschweiz.messnetz-parameter/KLIB.csv
